Subject: [PATCH] UBUNTU: SAUCE: skip fanotify09 test #2 for older kernels

BugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1804594

Test case #2 was added to fanotify09 as a regression test for the
following upstream commit:

b469e7e47c8a fanotify: fix handling of events on child sub-directory

which has been applied to v4.20 and backported to linux-4.19.y upstream
stable.

We have backported this change to Bionic and it was included on
4.15.0-59. The backport for 4.4.0 and older kernels are not
straightforward, so skip testcase #2 for kernels older than 4.15.0.
